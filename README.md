Automated File Deletion Script for Windows System
Purpose:
The Python script is designed to automate the process of permanently deleting files and directories from a Windows system. The script traverses through the entire file system, excluding Windows system directories, and removes files and directories without asking for confirmation each time.

Important Note:
This script is a powerful tool that should be used with extreme caution. Running this script without understanding its consequences may result in data loss and system instability. It is strongly recommended to have a backup of important data before using this script.

Script Components:
Platform Check:

The script checks if it is running on a Windows system using the platform.system() function.
Windows System Directory Check:

It verifies that the script is not executed from a Windows system directory to prevent accidental damage to critical system files.
Function Definitions:

is_windows(): A helper function that returns True if the script is running on a Windows system.
is_windows_system_directory(directory): A helper function that checks if a given directory is a Windows system directory.
File Deletion Function:

delete_files(folder_path): A function that recursively deletes files and directories from the specified folder path.
Main Function (main()):

Checks if the script is running on a Windows system and if it is not executed from a Windows system directory.
Asks the user for confirmation only once before proceeding with the file deletion process.
If the user confirms by typing 'yes,' the script determines the root drive, calls the delete_files function, and displays success messages.
If the user provides any other input or types 'no,' the script exits without performing any action.
How to Use:
Run the script using Python (python script_name.py).
The script checks if it is running on a Windows system and if it is not executed from a Windows system directory.
Asks the user for confirmation only once before proceeding.
If the user types 'yes,' the script deletes files and directories from the entire system (excluding Windows system directories).
Displays success messages after completion.
If the user types 'no' or any other input, the script exits without performing any action.
Important Considerations:
Caution:

Use this script with extreme caution, as it can result in irreversible data loss.
Always have a backup of critical data before running the script.
Automated Operation:

The script performs automated file deletion without asking for confirmation for each file. Ensure you understand the potential consequences before running it.
Limited User Input:

The script asks for user confirmation only once to avoid unnecessary interruptions during the automated process.
Security and Responsibility:
System Impact:

Running this script can impact the entire file system. Ensure that you have administrative privileges and understand the potential risks.
Responsibility:

Use this script responsibly, and only in scenarios where file deletion from the entire system is necessary.
This script is a powerful tool that provides automation for file deletion on a Windows system. However, the user must exercise caution and responsibility when using such scripts to avoid unintended consequences.
